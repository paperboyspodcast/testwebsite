In a new paper in Nature, Google recently claimed that they achieved "quantum supremacy," or using a quantum computer to achieve a task that a classical computer could not. However, not everyone agrees with Google's results. IBM released a paper at nearly the same time that scrutinizes Google's calculations. Listen as Charlie and James dive into this week's paper and unpack this interesting debate on quantum computing research!
