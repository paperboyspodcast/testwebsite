Saturn’s tiny moon Enceladus is of great interest to scientists for its unique features and potential for life. Despite its far distance from the sun, a vast ocean exists under its surface, and geyser-like jets regularly shoot water vapor into its atmosphere and space. For many years, planetary scientists have wondered how four deep, nearly parallel trenches formed near the planet’s south pole. Join us this week and Charlie and James nerd out on an excellent paper that digs into this mystery of Enceladus’ “tiger stripe” trenches.
