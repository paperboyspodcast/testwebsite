What does a phytoplankton virus have to do with the annual snowfall at a ski resort? It turns out they're more related than you think! James brings in two papers on cloud seeding that explore the ways scientists have been changing the weather since the 1940s.

Check out the Science Mag article [here](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/08/alga-may-be-seeding-world-s-skies-clouds), the Cell paper about phytoplankton [here](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(18)30105-6), and cloud seeing paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/115/6/1168).
