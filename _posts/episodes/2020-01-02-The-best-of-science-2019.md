Over the course of the year, there are many papers we don’t have a chance to dive into. Join us this week as we cover some of the best research that didn’t make it into one of our episodes in 2019. Happy new year, and here’s to more exciting science coverage in 2020!
	
[Here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/da.22950) is a paper about dark chocolate reducing depression.

[Here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/da.22950) is an article about cleaning products being linked to childhood obesity.

[One](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau3333) about a link between gingivitis and Alzheimers.

And [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/02/13/1818350116) is an exciting one about grapes popping in the microwave! (Plus an awesome YouTube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCrtk-pyP0I)).

Happy new year!
