Everyone knows about magnetic fields, but very few people know what they really are and what they're capable of. Charlie brings in a paper from an experiment that broke a magnetic field world record...and blew itself up in the process.

[Check out the paper here](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5044557). Also [watch the explosion here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsu6FG_3adU) and [read the Newsweek article here](https://www.newsweek.com/record-breaking-magnetic-field-stronger-earth-1125817),
