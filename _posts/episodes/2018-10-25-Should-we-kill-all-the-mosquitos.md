Did you know mosquitoes are the deadliest animal on Earth? (Neither did we!) With gene editing, it may be possible to eradicate these bugs that transmit diseases to humans...but is it a good idea to kill an entire species? In this episode, James dives into the science of how researchers aim to do this (and whether they should).
