Most people don’t need an excuse to drink caffeine in the morning. Pick your poison: whether it’s coffee, tea, or an extra large Red Bull, caffeine’s psychoactive effects are evident. But could that same drug be kickstarting your body to burn more calories that you would be otherwise? Join us this week as James looks at new research studying the effects of caffeine on “brown fat,” the fat we have that helps regulate our body temps and keep us healthy (as opposed to “white fat” that stores energy).

Check out the paper from Scientific Reports, available [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45540-1) and the WebMD article [here](https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20190625/could-coffee-be-a-help-in-weight-loss#1)
