Astronomers have noticed a strange clustering of objects orbiting our solar system very far from the sun. Their grouping suggests that there might be a planet (dubbed “Planet 9”) responsible for this strange behavior. However, new research has proposed the idea that instead of being a planet, “Planet 9” could instead be a primordial black hole! Join us this week as Charlie dives into the paper behind this exciting proposition - and stay tuned to the end when Charlie blows James' mind with the size of the black hole.
