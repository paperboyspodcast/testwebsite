With their breeding sites heavily dependent on sea ice, Emperor penguins are extremely impacted by climate change in Antarctica. The 2016  Paris Climate agreement sought the commitment of nations to keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees centigrade, but how would this level of warming impact emperor penguin populations? Join us this week as Charlie and James explore a new paper that sees if the goals of the Paris Climate agreement are enough to save the penguins.
