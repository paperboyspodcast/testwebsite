When you look at Da Vinci's art, it's not hard to see why he's hailed as a genius. But he may have had a little trick up his sleeve that helped him see the world a little differently than most people, in the form of an eye disorder shared by Picasso, Rembrandt, and even Ryan Gosling. Charlie brings in a paper that tries to determine if Da Vinci had a condition known as strabismus.

Check out the original paper by Prof. Christian Tyler [here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/article-abstract/2707245) and the Washington Post article [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/19/leonardo-da-vincis-genius-may-be-rooted-in-a-common-eye-disorder-new-study-says/?utm_term=.72df7a1981f2).
