Over a year ago we covered the challenges that NASA’s InSight lander overcame to land on Mars and begin performing the first detailed seismographic measurements of Mars. The InSight science team has just published the initial findings from InSight’s measurements, detailing unexpected results about Mars’ seismic activity, magnetism, and more. Join us this week as Charlie and James explore InSight’s exciting new findings.
