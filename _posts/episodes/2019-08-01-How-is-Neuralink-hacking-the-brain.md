News channels have been buzzing with the new press releases from Elon Muskâ€™s brain-computer interface company, Neuralink. The company hopes to develop new devices that could change the way humans interact with technology by interfacing directly to the brain. Join us this week as James dives into a publicly-available paper published by Neuralink to learn more about the technology that has lit up popular science news.

Check out the paper from BioRxiv, available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/703801v1) and the article in the Vanity Fair [here](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/elon-musk-neuralink-created-threads-to-weave-computer-into-your-brain).
