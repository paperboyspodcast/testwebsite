 The Stanford Prison Experiment is one of the most well-known research endeavors of the 20th century.  A group of psychologists had undergraduate students play "guard" or "prisoner" in a fake prison, just to see what would happen.  Let's just say it didn't go well - the experiment was cancelled after just 6 days and 5 students being dismissed for extreme emotional trauma.  What led to these conditions?  Were the researchers to blame for things going wrong, or is it just human nature?  What can we infer about ourselves from such a powerful experiment?  Join us for our Bonus Episode as we dive into the most disturbing read yet on the Paper Boys bonus episodes.
