Voyager 2 launched in 1977 and in 1986 made our first--and so far only--visit to the outer planet Uranus. Now, over 34 years later, we are still learning new things from the mission, including how Uranusâ€™ magnetic field interacts with the solar wind. Join us this week as Charlie and James dive into new discoveries about our distant neighbor in the solar system.
