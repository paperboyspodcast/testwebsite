There's a giant ice disk hanging out in the Presumpscot River in Westbrook, Maine that's garnered international attention, and rightfully so - it's an extremely rare phenomenon and this is one of the biggest ever recorded. Crazily, the ice disk is spinning completely on its own. Charlie brings in a paper that discovered just how ice disks like this can spontaneously rotate - and let's just say it's cooler than being cool. 

Check out the original paper in APS [here](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.033112) and the Portland Patch article [here](https://patch.com/maine/portland-me/spinning-ice-disk-maine-raises-speculation-alien-invasion).
