(WARNING: Do not listen with young children!!) For Christmas Eve, the Paper Boys tackle the everlasting mythos of Santa Claus. Why do parents encourage kids to believe? What reactions do kids have when they learn the truth? How far do some parents go to keep the dream alive? Do parents know how upset kids really are to learn the truth? Join us as we dive into a doctoral dissertation (with references all the way back to 1896!) exploring all these questions and more.

P.S. we made this episode to come out on December 26th originally, but weâ€™re releasing on Christmas Eve as an early present - so forgive our endless Boxing Day references!
