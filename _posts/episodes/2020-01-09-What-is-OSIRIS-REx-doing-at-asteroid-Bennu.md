OSIRIS-REx is an exciting mission from NASA that seeks to return samples from asteroid Bennu back to Earth, providing insight into the original building blocks of our solar system. Touchdown on the asteroid is expected in August 2020, but the spacecraft has already learned a ton about its target. Join us this week as Charlie and James dive into a paper about new findings from OSIRIS-REx.
