Titan is the only moon in the solar system that has an atmosphere, and its origin is still a hotly studied mystery. However, ESA's Rosetta mission that landed on Comet 67P made some startling discoveries that made scientists rethink how Titan could be generating its nitrogen-rich atmosphere. In this episode of Paper Boys, Charlie dives into the journal paper behind these new revelations and goes off on science headlines that conjour up the imagery of "cooked organics."
